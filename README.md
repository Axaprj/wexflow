Wexflow is an open source and cross-platform workflow engine and automation platform that aims to automate recurring tasks. With the help of Wexflow, building automation and workflow processes become easy.

Wexflow provides a cross-platform workflow server, a backend for designing, managing, and tracking workflows, sequential workflows, flowchart workflows, and approval workflows on generic business objects called records.

Wexflow automates the process of organizing, storing, manipulating files, provides more than 100+ activities, and allows custom integration with other solutions through custom activities or Wexflow API.
